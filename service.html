          The world today seems to run on apps. If it is something that people can interact with, then it’s likely that there is an app available for it. Well designed apps are eye-catching and make you want to use them, whilst poorly designed ones are just frustrating and don’t do what we want them to. While some basics such as usability, functionality and layout help the user experience, one of the most complained about issues with apps are the features, be it lack of expected ones or bad use of those which are there.</p>
